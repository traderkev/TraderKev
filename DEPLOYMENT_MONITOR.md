### Build Logs:

- No error messages about missing environment variables
- Successful deployment message

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### If Build Fails:

#### Common Issues:
1. **Missing Secrets**: Check all 5 secrets are added
2. **Wrong Secret Names**: Must match exactly:
   - `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `REACT_APP_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

3. **GitHub Pages Not Enabled**: Go to Pages settings

#### How to Fix:
1. Check the error in Actions log
2. Fix the issue (add missing secrets, etc.)
3. Push a new commit to trigger rebuild

### If Site Doesn't Load:
1. **Wait**: First deployment can take 10-15 minutes
2. **Check URL**: https://traderkev.github.io/TraderKev
3. **Verify GitHub Pages**: Should show green checkmark in settings
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
