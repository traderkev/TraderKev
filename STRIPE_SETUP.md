# Stripe + Firestore Payment Integration Setup Guide

## 🚀 Complete Payment System Setup

This guide will help you set up Stripe payments with Firestore database integration for your TraderKev website.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Stripe Account**: Sign up at [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. **Firebase/Firestore**: Already configured in your project
3. **EmailJS**: Already configured for confirmation emails

## 🔧 Step 1: Stripe Dashboard Setup

### Create Stripe Account & Get Keys
1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to **Developers** → **API Keys**
4. Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
5. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

### Configure Products (Optional)
1. Go to **Products** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Create a product: "TraderKev Mentorship Program"
3. Set price: $497.00
4. Note the Price ID for advanced integrations

## 🔧 Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your actual Stripe keys:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
REACT_APP_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

**Important**: 
- Never commit your secret key to version control
- Use test keys during development
- Switch to live keys only for production

## 🔧 Step 3: Firestore Database Rules

Update your Firestore security rules to allow payment record creation:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to create payment records
    match /payments/{paymentId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Your existing rules...
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Step 4: EmailJS Template for Payment Confirmation

Create a new EmailJS template for payment confirmations:

### Template ID: `template_payment_confirmation`

```html
Subject: Payment Confirmation - TraderKev Mentorship Program

Hi {{to_name}},

## 🔧 Step 5: Testing the Payment System

### Test Cards (Use in Development)
- **Successful Payment**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined Payment**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Authentication Required**: 4000 0025 0000 3155

### Test Process
1. Click "🚀 SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW" button
2. Fill out customer information
3. Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
4. Any future expiry date (12/25)
5. Any 3-digit CVC (123)
6. Any ZIP code (12345)

## 📊 Step 6: Monitoring Payments

### Stripe Dashboard
- View all payments in **Payments** section
- Monitor failed payments in **Disputes** section
- Track revenue in **Reports** section

### Firestore Console
- Check `payments` collection for stored records
- Each document contains:
  - Customer information
  - Payment details
  - Timestamp
  - Payment status

### EmailJS Dashboard
- Monitor email delivery in EmailJS dashboard
- Check for failed email sends

## 🛡️ Step 7: Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Keep secret keys in `.env.local` only
- Never expose secret keys in client-side code
- Use different keys for development/production

### Webhooks (Advanced)
For production, consider implementing Stripe webhooks to:
- Verify payment completion server-side
- Handle subscription events
- Process refunds automatically

### Data Validation
- Always validate payment amounts server-side
- Verify customer information
- Log all payment attempts
